This repository will serve as documentation for the computational aspects of my rotation project in the Eroglu Lab (10/22/22 - 12/16/22). 

See my labarchives folder ("Hailey N. Oct 2022" in the "Rotations Students" directory within Kristina Sakers's labarchives notebook) for full descriptions of experiments and analysis. 

*all_scripts* contains all of the scripts I wrote and used during my rotation.

*r_scripts* contains only r scripts

*shell_scripts* contains shell scripts I ran on DCC
